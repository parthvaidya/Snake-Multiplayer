# Snake-Multiplayer
Hi welcome to the Snake Multiplayer Game made by me
This game is built on Unity and C# enitirely.

# Game Modes:
1 Single Player Mode: 
You have a snake which can move in all 4 directions Snake Eats Apple so make sure to make it full. Also there are some surprise powerups added 

2 Multiplayer Mode: 
 A two-player game where one sneak will move using WASD and another will move using arrow keys.
 If Snake A bites snake B then snake B will die, and vice versa.

 # Also the Snake to score 15 points first wins the game!!!
